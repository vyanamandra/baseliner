An easy deployment &amp; demo of applications for Consul over VMs.

--> Work in progress. 

Need to add custom applications to this now.

Along the way, we will add -

1. Ingress gateways.
2. Terminating gateways.
3. API gateways.
4. All custom applications and tools for troubleshooting.
5. Cluster Peering.
6. Admin partitions.


Then, we will proceed to add support for Azure and GCP.

In mind is to add support for joining DCs in different regions of the same cloud. e.g., one DC from the us-east-1 region while the other from the us-west-2 region of AWS.
