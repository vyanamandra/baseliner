# baseliner
An easy deployment &amp; demo of applications for Consul over VMs.

--> Work in progress. The code needs to be made resilient on failures (e.g., unable to bootstrap, unable to run a specific task... etc,) and it is not right now. 
but, stay tuned!


The goal is to get some resiliency on failures.
Possible ETA: To complete the work by today evening & merge it to the main branch.
